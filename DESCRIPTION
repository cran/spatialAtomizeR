Description: Implements atom-based regression models (ABRM) for analyzing spatially 
    misaligned data. Provides functions for simulating misaligned spatial data, 
    preparing NIMBLE model inputs, running MCMC diagnostics, and comparing different 
    spatial analysis methods including dasymetric mapping. All main functions return
    S3 objects with print(), summary(), and plot() methods for intuitive result exploration.
    Methods are described in Nethery et al. (2023) <doi:10.1101/2023.01.10.23284410>.
    Further methodological details and software implementation are described in Qian et al. (in review).
